# Look Look !....how cringe I was

You may find incredibly **herrilious, lifeless files** here 

These are my old C++ experiments—random chaos, messy names, and a lot of cringe—but each file holds a piece of my learning journey.  
Some might be broken, some might be hilariously bad, but all of them were stepping stones to becoming better.  


- The files are mostly my **learning attempts** from over time.  
- Names are **nonsense**, because back then I had zero naming skills .  
- I kept them here so I don’t lose these **memories** or any **useful snippets**.  
- This repo is basically a **digital dumpster** of my early coding days—**handle with humor**!  

Feel free to scroll, laugh, cry, or even learn something from my chaotic past
